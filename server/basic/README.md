Basic Query Example
---
This is an example of serving up queries with Morpheus. It is the mythology example extracted from [morpheus-graphql/examples/](https://github.com/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql/tree/master/examples).

Instead of using template haskell to read in a schema.gql file and generating
types, it uses native haskell types for defining its graphql api.


Instructions
---
Build using `cabal new-build` and run using `cabal new-exec basic`.

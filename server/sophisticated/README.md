Sophisticated Server Example
---

This is a more complex example demonstrating all the bells and whistles of using Morpheus-GraphQL on the server. It is extracted from [morpheus-graphql/examples/](https://github.com/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql/tree/master/examples).

This example relies on the latest branch of morpheus-graphql as of this writing, which is why we've added a cabal.project which fetches the repo and compiles it locally.


Instructions
---

Build using `cabal new-build` and run using `cabal new-exec sophisticated`.
